We added tags that focused on specific illnesses cats and dogs encounter
### Task 1
We added tags that focused on specific illnesses cats and dogs encounter
### Task 2
Brain stormed features around disability access to make our app more inclusive- such as test to speech reading of text on the space, free engines are available and potential dyslexia filter that changes ther background from hwite to off-yellow or other choices of dyslexia frinedly backgrounds,
this makes it easier for people to read the text if they have dyslexia 
### Issues
Illness tags are not producing good enough confidence scores yet, also we are changing to a different azue pricing tier as the free tiral expire which could prove a big roadblock
### Day 2
#### Tasks Completed
We continued adding images to train the AI and compared it with an AI Ben Made where we exclusively used images related to animal diseases.
### Task 1
I added the images of animals with diseases to our existing model and trained them by manually labelling, however after we trained it we got confidence scores in the 40% and 50% for the diseases
### Task 2
Ben made a different AI that was only trained on images of animals with diseases. This is because we believed the increased model complexity due to all the exisiting tags was making it less receptive to learning how to analayse the new tags we were adding. I ran tests of different images and scenarios on both the exisiting AI and the new one, however they both performed about the same
### Issues
We found out that simplfliying the data set does not make it more precise and it does just need more balanced images where the new tags are shown in as amny possible situations, therefore we require more well-balanced examples to give the AI  a more holistic understing of what the tag is.
### Day 3
#### Tasks Completed
We trained the AI again with more varied illness images and then got some better confidence scores in the 70-80% range, trained it and saw that azure was not charging me any thing. 
### Task 1
We provided the superior images for training, making sure we covered previous blind spots such as too few images of unhealthy eyes and I also introduced negative tags such as healthy eys vs unhealthy yes and healthy skin vs unhealthy skin.
This helped masively improve image recognition perfomance thus boosting confidence scores from medium to high confidence (40% to 65%+).
### Task 2
I checked my azure account and made sure before running the training of the AI and made sure that I did not exceed my available allowance of tags, images analysed and time spent training as I really did not want to have to pay for using the AI, for this project. That would hamper our ability to test as we'd have to reduce our image sample size or potentially even chnage the Ai engine we're using, however now I'm certain we should be fine and it should not prove a limiting factor.
