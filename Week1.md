In week 1, we spent the time setting up the collaboration tools. I took ownership as I have some working experience and helped facilitate a collaborative working environment.
I made copies of the portofolio and shared them with the rest of the team using google docs. This ensure live and easy collaboration on the portofolio.

During that I also spent some time to get to know my twam members so we know everyone's strengths and prefferences.
After that we started delegating tasks on completing the portofolio. I began work requirement which I made sure to write following the same format as given in the example.
