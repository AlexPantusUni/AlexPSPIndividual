### Week 2
### Tasks Completed
In week 2, I spent the time working on the portfolio and preparing for our meeting with Elanco next week
### Task 1
We discussed assigning roles and i was assigned the scrum master role. I began doing tasks fitting my role by writing user stories and the MoSCoW analysis.
### Task 2
I started writing questions to send to Elanco in an email and also some for the meeting. I passed the questions on to Lenisha who is the product owner and therefore could 
relay them on to the Elanco liason.
### Task to Do
For Next Week we have our meeting with our client Elanco so we need to be prepared for any feedback tomorrow and implement that into a plan for the
program we want to deliver
### Issues
We had a couple people absent as they had a cold but they should be back next week
