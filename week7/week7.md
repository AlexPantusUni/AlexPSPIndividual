### Week 7
### Tasks Completed
In week 7, we discussed the feedback we got from the client and how we can go about it, also had a look at how azure is going to chnage once my free trial expires
### Task 1
I discussed with the team about how to act upon the feedbvack we received on week, I advised that based on the feedback our aim should be to make the program be as useful for our end user as possible and 
therefore we need to link all new existing dfunctionalityto our userts which are pet wornes and farmers and make sure that our program helps solve one of their issues they might have with their respective animals.
We brainstormed as a team together and came up with the idea to generate a better response for the user, something like "based on these tags we belive that your cat" might have cataracts" maybe add a % to display that and make sure that the 
tags that show the animsla nd the disease can chnage easily. Implementing this will require syncronisation between me on the AI side and Sebastatian on the JavaScript side.
### Task 2
I looked at the Azure account and the services we were using for storage and AI functionalities and did a cost analysis of how much it's going to cost me to continue using it after the free trial expired.
We got given Â£150 free credit but now that it expired, I would prefer not to have to pay a lot of money for it.
I have assessed different services and looked at the price sheet for continuing to use Azure blob storage and Custom Vision and think that the correct decision is to pay the fees as to not have to restart the development process using a different AI.
It will cost me a bit of money however the sum is not that muich and the program is very good so far.
### Task to Do
Now we need to start taking some actionalbe steps towards improving the AI and making decisions on all the features we need to do to improve the program.
### Issues
Currently we don't have so many ideas for freatures so we will need to do more brain-storming and perhaps be open to on the go chnages to the plan if a good idea comes up which might add unforseen complexity to the project
