### Week 9

### Tasks Completed
In week 9, I discussed what tags we want to add to our AI and what challenges we might face in that process, we also discussesd what tasks everyone will be doing
and how they all will fit into making the app better for the user.
### Task 1
Me and Ben brainstormed the tags our AI needs, we came to the conclusion that our AI is not sophisticated enough in spotting specific animal illnesses.
To change this we researched some of the popular diseases and illnesses that animals face, 
We have decided that to ensure we better serve our end user and to make sure we have the time to make the required changes to the AI, we will only focus this disease finding 
on a select group of animals. cats and dogs for pet oweners and cows, sheep, horses and pigs for farmers. 
This will greatly streamline our development process and help us stay under the 2000 images limit that is present on the 
under
### Task 2
We have finalised what tasks and focus everyone should have for the sprint week. 
We've maintained the same basic structure as sprint week 1 where it's 1 area of the app with its respective tool done by a person. 
We make sure to combine them and maintain compatibility along the way
Me and ben will continue working on the AI, with me taking charge of the model and Ben providing appropriate images and advising me when needed on changes to make. 
### Task to Do
Next week we have our sprint week and everyone has been assigned a set of tasks and knows what to do. I will be doing the work on the AI model alongside Ben.
We have a lot of changes to make to the model as we need to implement all the tags we've dicussed about.
### Issues
We have received a lot of feedback regarding the AI, so we will need to work a lot on it.
We might even need to allocate another person to asist me and Ben on it as the usefullness of the program is greatly contiengent on the usefullness of the AI and
currenlty it is not quite where we'd want it to be and we need to prioritise it. But we should wait and see how we progress in the first couple days of the sprint week.
