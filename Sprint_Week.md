### Sprint Week
### Tasks Completed
In Sprint Week I completed different tasks every single day, I mostly worked on trainign the AI model, the integration between the azure API into our codebase and implementing the image uploading functionality.
### Day 1 Tasks
On day 1, me and Ben worked on implemening the Image Uploading functionality in Javascript. We split the task in two equal parts and combined our version to create a functional program. 
I also set up my Azure infrastrucure so that I can access Azure Custom Vision, which is the AI we decided on as a team for our project. I began compiling images to train the AI.
### Day 2 Tasks
On day 2, I started running the first iterastions of the AI. However I noticed the AI was not performing very well so I shifted to finding images that would make the AI better whilst Ben labelled the images for later training.
### Day 3 Tasks
On day 3, I spent time collaborating with Sebastian trying to inetgrate my trained Custom Vision API into our program. We had quite a few difficulties as Azure is a very complex tool with many requirements for pushing an API but we figure it ut in the end.
It required me to make some chnages in our resoruce management within the Azure hub. After we established the connection between the API and our website, I went back to training trhe AI with all the images that have been gathered and did some testing. 
Lastlty, I did special training for the AI and let it run overnight.
### Day 4 Tasks
On day 4, I did more testing with the custom vision iteration I ran over night. Due to the longer run time and the better data set used for this iteration. The AI was much more accurate so I focused mostly on testing it and pushing this new version to the live server for our meeting which we had on this day

### Task to Do
For Next Week we have our last week of planning before spring week I'm going to try to write down a plan of the tasks that need to be doen and the vison for our program in a concrete way so everyone is alligned.
### Issues
We haven't had much experience working with an AI and training it so it might be challeging to get started and work with.
