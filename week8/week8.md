### Week 8
### Tasks Completed
In week 8, I spent most of the time alligning with the team on what tasks to do
### Task 1
I discussed with Seb on the idea of making our website work for mobile devices and what the logistics behind it would require and how we could plan for it 
.e.g changes in CSS, whether or how existing fcuntionality will have to be changed
### Task 2
I also tried to start on the implementing of the advice based system functionality. 
This essentially requires me to improve the tag generation on the AI and to allign have that allign with potential diseases, 
then on the javascript side these tags will be pulled and generate an output, however I need to get the appropriate tags to be outputter by the AI with 90%+ accuracry.
### Task to Do
For Next Week we have our last week before sprint week 2 so I need to sit together with my team and devise a well thought out plan for what tasks everyone is going to do for
each day of the sprint and how we will combine it all
### Issues
We have had some issues with understanding how exacly we can imrpove our app and make it be better for the user, so we will sti down a 
devise an accurate plan with all the improvements needed and how we will implement it.
